Assignment 1 - Develop Web App in ASP.NET 22 Winter


.......Getting Started.......

started working on my Assignment 1, my assigned topic for the Assignment 1 is Sandals.

created a Web App using the tutorial by selecting the ASP.NET Core Web app (Model-View-Controller) in Visual Studio 2019.

Navigate to each folder and try to understand what it is...

After understanding and confirm that each file is present in my Project, I tried to run the app and try to see if there will an error or not.

yes, it's I got my desired output which I actually run the app and everything seems to be correct as of now.....

Tried to edit the Welcome message in the app's home screen and replace the Welcome word with "Welcome to the Utkarsh Sandals Store!" in h3 tag and commenting out the link which is located below the message called Welcome.

Tried to run the app and hope it will displays as my expection....

yes it will shows an message correctly, after that I modified the message for the privacy page as well as change the description in the paragraph tag in it..

I tried to customized the default messages according the product assigned to me...

next I added a new page called AboutUs to my home page by creating the razor page called - AboutUs.cshtml in the home folder of Views.

after that I included the link to my homepage using the nav tag in the file called - _Layout.cshtml

and finally add a code to return a view of the file called AboutUs.cshtml file...if user clicked on the link called About Us from the home page.
